    <h1>Navigation</h1>
    <p>You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my
  blog</a>, from whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> are littered. Far up thus mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me, desperately scribbling
      a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.</p>
    <p>To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled <a href="http://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more boring-looking exit is labeled <a href="http://isp.example.net/">ISP™</a>.</p>
    <p>To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts
  page</a>. Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run quickly out of the page.</p>

<!--
Notes:
<nav>
represents section of the page that links to other pages or to parts
within the page

Note:
- Use list markup <ul> if the nav elements respresents a list
-	It is common for footers to have a short list of links to various pages of a site,
	such as the terms of service, the home page, and a copyright page
	Footer element is alone sufficient for such cases
- Nav element helps user agents such as screen readers which help blind users
	to understand/view available pages and navigate across them

Inference:
Use nav markup section when the links inside them helps to navigate around the application (primary)
as well it can navigate around the page/aritcle (secondary nav)

<nav> which is a sectioning content can be a child of another sectionning content
especially <aside>. Similar to <section> inside <article>
