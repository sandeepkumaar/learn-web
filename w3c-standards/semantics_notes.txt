/#############################################/
<body>
- The body element represents the content of the document
- there is only one body element

/#############################################/
<article>
article elelment represents
	- a complete/self contained independently distributable / shared

Eg:Forum post, magazine, newspaper article, blog entry, widgets
Note:
When article elements are nested, the inner article elements represent
articles that are in principle related to the contents of the outer article

Eg:A blog entry which is an article accepts user comments. The comment section
could be an inner article since the comments involves long posts
/#############################################/
<section>
Represents generic section of the document or application
A thematic grouping of elements
Theme of each section should be identified typically including header

Note:
section element is not a generic container element
the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be
listed explicitly in the document's outline.
Eg:	chapters in a story
		tabbed pages



/#############################################/
<nav>
represents section of the page that links to other pages or to parts
within the page

Note:
- Use list markup <ul> if the nav elements respresents a list
-	It is common for footers to have a short list of links to various pages of a site,
	such as the terms of service, the home page, and a copyright page
	Footer element is alone sufficient for such cases
- Nav element helps user agents such as screen readers which help blind users
	to understand/view available pages and navigate across them

Inference:
Use nav markup section when the links inside them helps to navigate around the application (primary)
as well it can navigate around the page/aritcle (secondary nav)

/#############################################/
<aside>
Represents the section of the page that is tangentially related to the content
around(article) the aside element.which would be considered seperate from the content

What is inter-element whitespace?
	The space characters are always allowed between elements
	User agents represent these(space char) characters between elements in the
source markup as Text nodes in the DOM
  Empty Text nodes and Text nodes consisting of just sequences of those(space) characters
are considered inter-element whitespace.

<p>(inter-element-white space introduced after close tag'>')
paragrapht content
</p>
<p>paragraph content coming right after the close tag '>' with no new line</p>
The above p tag does not have inter-element-white space

this can be achieved also through
<p
	>paragraph content</p>

why?
sometimes elements behave differently when inter-element-white space is introduced
eg. <div class='inline-block'></div>
Hence watch for those
